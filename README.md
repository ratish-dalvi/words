# words

This repository assists in learning low-frequency words, their meanings, and usage by creating an audio file for playback. Over the years, I had collected screenshots of unfamiliar words on my phone. The notebook `screenshot-to-text` utilizes a Phi3 vision model to convert these screenshots into a CSV file containing the words, their meanings, usage, and synonyms. The second script, `convert_to_audio`, uses this CSV file to generate an audio file for learning words.
